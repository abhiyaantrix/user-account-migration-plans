# Unified User Accounts with Upsert

The problem and objectives stay the same.

Instead of creating intermediate temporary table before deduplication, we might be able to achieve this in much pragmatic method.

`Upsert` directly into `Users` table which will ensure that either update if present and insert new if not.

One potential drawback would be that validations and callbacks are skipped on `Users` table.
If this is a blocker original plan can still be a valid way to achieve the objectives.
